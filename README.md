# Fun-with-Python
Creative ideas and programs using python.

The idea of the repository is to give a platform for people to share something interesting they find about python. 

We have the following categories
- Data visualisations
- Web/Server Apps
- Interesting applications
- Library tricks and cheatsheets


Do feel free to discuss about adding an additional category. To contribute simply, add your program as a directory into the following category directories. Your program should contain a simple README so that people understand what it does, and how to use it. Do feel free to write tests to it.

Happy coding !
